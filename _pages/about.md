Hi there! I'm Peter - the only code-crunching, networking-nurturing, cybersecurity sleuthing, pun-spewing tech guru you'll find in this corner of the internet.

I've got a resume that stretches longer than a Python script with no comments (which can both be a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on whose Python code you're looking at):

1. Mobile dev? Check.
2. Backend web dev with (based) frontend opinions? Double check.
3. (Former) CCNA instructor? Yup.
4. Oh, yeah, I got that CEH certificate.

My philosophy is simple - mix technical know-how with people skills, toss in a healthy respect for security, shake it all up, and _ево га_! You've got a delicious cocktail of client satisfaction. Just watch out for the hangover.

Now, I've got a thing for Flutter and native Android (Kotlin and Java, if you're asking), but I'm also courting Nest.js and Go. It's a bit of a coding love square, you could say.

Speaking of love, let's talk about [r/mAndroidDev](https://www.reddit.com/r/mAndroidDev/). It's my favorite subreddit. Why? Because I enjoy triggering my PTSD. That's right, there's no better way to start the day than remembering the times before coroutines when we were using [`AsyncTask`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/os/AsyncTask.java). Oh, the nostalgia! _Please erase my memory..._

I'm also a big believer in the supremacy of TypeScript over JavaScript. In my book, JavaScript is the wild west of the web, and TypeScript is the new sheriff in town. Because, let's be honest, in a world of `undefined is not a function`, who doesn't want a little extra safety? Also, if I see you use `any` when you're too lazy to figure out what the proper type should be... Oof.

Now, if you catch me shouting "KOTLIN!!!" at Twitter grifters asking about programming languages, don't be alarmed. It's just me being a Kotlin evangelist. Can I get ~~an amen~~ reified type parameter?

As for frontend frameworks, I've got to give it to Angular. Why? Because unlike other frameworks, I've already mastered Nest.js, and my brain can only hold so much. This, my friends, is what I call my "boomer developer" moment.

So, come join me in my quest to turn the web into a more secure, accessible, and humorous place. Or, just find me on Twitter, randomly expressing my inner developer thoughts. Who knows, I might even make you chuckle. I mean, we all need a good laugh when someone assigns you a Jira ticket with a title "Doesn't work" with no description.
