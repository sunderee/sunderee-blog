        <p>In the dynamic world of technology, there exists a broad spectrum of individuals, each with a unique approach to software engineering. Having spent a significant part of my career in consulting, I have had the opportunity to observe and work with a diverse range of engineers. This experience has allowed me to identify two distinct types of engineers that stand out: the safe players and the risk-takers.</p>
<p>On one side of the spectrum, there are those engineers who prefer to stay in their comfort zone, using tried-and-true tools and methodologies. These individuals tend to favor stability and reliability over novelty and risk. They opt for a slow but steady approach to change, preferring to gradually adapt their methods in response to industry shifts. They believe in the value of tried and tested technologies that have proven their worth over time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are the pioneers, the engineers who are always on the lookout for the latest and most significant trends in software engineering. These individuals are fearless in experimenting with new technologies, even when the results are uncertain. They thrive in the chaos of the 'Wild West' of software development, ready to seize innovation opportunities.</p>
<p>In the context of technology selection, these two types of engineers often fall into the categories of &quot;Boring Tech&quot; and &quot;Innovative Tech&quot; respectively. The term &quot;Boring Tech&quot; may initially sound unappealing, but it refers to languages and frameworks that are well-established, have large communities, and are battle-tested. They have been around the block, and their reliability is unquestionable.</p>
<p>&quot;Innovative Tech&quot;, in contrast, is a world filled with emerging languages and frameworks, still in their infancy but teeming with potential. These technologies are at the cutting edge, offering new paradigms and unique solutions to challenging problems. However, with innovation comes unpredictability. These technologies are often not as well-documented or widely supported as their more established counterparts, and their reliability is yet to be proven.</p>
<h2>Why Am I Writing This Article?</h2>
<p>Throughout my career, I have faced numerous challenges and learned several valuable lessons from the interactions I have had with various clients. Some of these lessons stem from my experiences working with clients in the public sector.</p>
<p>Firstly, it became apparent early on that there is a certain level of delicacy required when communicating with those who hold public office. I learned the hard way that mentioning terms such as &quot;bugs&quot; and &quot;issues&quot; can trigger a visceral negative emotional reaction. Instead, it proved to be more effective to phrase things in a way that highlights the solutions rather than the problems. Additionally, it became clear that going into too much technical detail can be overwhelming for them. As such, communication needed to be simplified to the extent that it could be understood by anyone, regardless of their technical literacy.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I found that clients often have high expectations that are not always in line with their investment. They see the polished, high-quality apps produced by companies employing a fleet of developers and expect the same level of output, often forgetting that those companies also invest significantly more resources into their development processes. It was a continuous balancing act, trying to manage these expectations while delivering the best possible product within the provided budget and resources.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most challenging aspects of client interactions was explaining the concept that &quot;some things are out of our control&quot;. Clients often have lofty ideas inspired by the seemingly limitless possibilities portrayed in movies and other media. When reality does not align with these dreams, it can lead to disappointment and even frustration. Providing proof doesn't always help, and can sometimes trigger a negative emotional reaction. In these situations, it became necessary to approach the conversation with tact and patience, handling their dreams delicately while also grounding them in reality.</p>
<h2>Innovative Tech</h2>
<p>The journey of my career has been significantly influenced by innovative technology. It was a leap of faith with Flutter, considered &quot;innovative tech&quot; at the time, that propelled my career forward. This experience underscored my belief that embracing challenges, even when they involve grappling with unfamiliar and sometimes unwieldy tools, can lead to substantial personal and professional growth.</p>
<p>Innovative tech is at the heart of the rapid advancement we witness in the tech industry today. It is the reason we have exciting new technologies like Bun, an upcoming alternative to Node.js. It's the reason why we have Flutter co-existing with React Native, providing developers with a diverse range of tools to create stunning mobile apps. It's the reason why Docker has revolutionized the way we deploy our backends, moving away from traditional virtual machines hosted on random on-premise servers.</p>
<p>Innovative tech is where the excitement and, sometimes, the chaos reside. The vibrancy of the Rust community, despite recent controversies, is a testament to the allure of innovative tech. However, it also has its downsides, as demonstrated by the rise of Web3 grifters exploiting the nascent and unregulated nature of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>One of the intriguing aspects of innovative tech is its potential to become conventional over time. Kotlin is a prime example of this. Once considered a second-class citizen in the realm of Android app development, it is now the de-facto standard, even driving the development of the modern UI toolkit Jetpack Compose. This transformation underlines the fact that today's innovation can become tomorrow's tradition.</p>
<p>While innovative tech can present a challenging path, it is undoubtedly an exciting one. It offers opportunities for personal growth, community building, and the chance to shape the future of technology. However, it's essential to balance this pursuit of innovation with a practical understanding of established, reliable technology. This balance, which I will delve into further in the next section, is critical to ensuring sustainable growth and success in our careers and projects.</p>
<h2>Boring Tech</h2>
<p>When it comes to boring tech, the pros are numerous. Choosing established technology can lead to improved productivity, with these technologies often enabling quicker and more efficient workload processing, thus increasing overall productivity and efficiency across business processes and operations​​. They also offer better communication, providing a wider range of tools for both internal and external audiences, which facilitates better interactions and connectivity​.</p>
<p>Moreover, established tech often comes with enhanced security checks that reduce the risks of data breaches and theft when compared to newer, less proven technologies​. They also allow businesses to meet evolving business dynamics. In the age of digital-first operating models, well-established technology has allowed businesses to create value chains, meet the changing demands of their customers, and achieve greater agility and resilience in their operations​.</p>
<p>However, it's also important to note that boring tech is not without its drawbacks. The costs of upgrading or migrating to new technology can be prohibitive, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that operate on tight budgets​. Integration and compatibility issues can also arise, as forcing new technology onto existing or outdated systems can lead to complications and potential risks to critical data due to incompatibility with the latest security updates and patches​. There's also the need for reskilling, upskilling, and training employees, as established tech often comes with complex features that employees may not be comfortable using, making change management a necessary component of any tech upgrade or migration.​</p>
<p>To conclude, it's worth stating that boring tech is only boring if you don't enjoy your job in the first place. It provides a stable and secure environment in which to work, and while it may not offer the thrill of venturing into unknown territory, it's a reliable choice that ensures the smooth functioning of operations.</p>
<p>Innovative tech, on the other hand, offers excitement and challenges that can be very fulfilling if you're solving problems you're interested in. It's where you'll find cutting-edge developments and groundbreaking ideas. But it also comes with its own set of risks and challenges, and it's not for everyone.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to stick with boring tech or venture into the realm of innovative tech, the most important thing is to find a balance that works for you and your project. Because at the end of the day, the best technology for the job is the one that best meets your needs and aligns with your capabilities and goals.</p>
<h2>Balance &amp; Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The world of technology is vast and varied, encompassing everything from well-established, tried-and-tested solutions to the latest cutting-edge innovations. As tech professionals, we often find ourselves at the crossroads of these two paths, making the challenging decision of whether to stick to the safety of what we know or venture into the unknown.</p>
<p>In my career, I've witnessed how different engineers approach this choice. Some prefer to stay in their comfort zone, gradually adapting their methods within the safety of well-established technologies. Others are more adventurous, eager to stay ahead of the curve and embrace the latest trends in software engineering. Both approaches have their merits and their challenges.</p>
<p>Working with public sector clients, I learned the importance of managing expectations, communicating effectively, and navigating the delicate balance between reality and aspiration. These experiences underscored the importance of choosing the right technology for the job, whether it's &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;innovative&quot;.</p>
<p>Innovative tech is thrilling. It's the driving force behind the rapid evolution of the tech industry, introducing fresh alternatives like Bun, expanding the toolbox with frameworks like Flutter, and revolutionizing deployment with technologies like Docker. It's a territory of excitement, but also of unpredictability, requiring readiness to tackle the unknown and resilience to weather the storms of controversy and exploitation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, boring tech, or well-established technology, offers stability and reliability. It's a proven path that leads to improved productivity, enhanced communication, and better data security. It can keep pace with evolving business dynamics, reduce reliance on manpower for repetitive tasks, and offer security in high-stakes situations. However, it comes with its own set of challenges, including integration issues, the cost of technology upgrades, and the need for reskilling and upskilling employees.</p>
<p>In the end, it's not about choosing between boring and innovative tech. Instead, it's about striking a balance, about understanding when to stick to the tried-and-tested and when to take a leap of faith into the new. It's about remembering that it's not the technology that's boring or innovative, but rather our approach to it, and our willingness to adapt, learn, and grow. And finally, it's essential to remember that at the end of the day, users don't care if your backend is built in .NET or Zig from a master branch. They won't ask if your native Android app is built with Java, XML views, and RxJava, or if you're using Flutter and Clojure. Users care about the product. They want something that works, that serves their needs, that makes their lives easier or more enjoyable. So choose the best tool for the job, the one that allows you to create the best possible product for your users.</p>
<p>After all, that's what technology is all about.</p>
